var sys = Application("System Events");
sys.keyCode(36, {using: []}); // 36: Enter / Return
```

Delays:

```js
var sys = Application("System Events");
sys.keystroke("text you want to type in");

playlist = playlist.split("\n");

const activeChar = '!';

var app = Application("Discord");
app.activate();

for(var index in playlist){
  var item = playlist[index];
